Test Strategy:Steps(ITDS)

1.Assess Testability:
2.operability:4
3.controllability:5
4.observability:5
5.simplicity:3
6.undestandability:5
7.suitabilty:5
8.Stability:5

Test Factors:
1.Authorization-Integration testing
2.Correctness-Integration testing
3.Access control-system testing
4.Reliabilty--UAT
5.performance-system
6.integrity-system testing
7.continuity of processing:post UAT


Assess drivers that would influence testing/approach:

Authorization-Integration-tester(Quality analyst)/validation/blackbox testing
Correctness-Integration--tester/validation/blackbox testing/dynamic
Access control-system testing--tester/verification/blackbox testing
Reliabilty-UAT--client/customer/verification/Black Box testing
performance-system--tester/validation/black box testing
integrity-system testing--tester/blackbox/validation 
continuity of processing:post UAT--client/verification/BlackBox testing

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test plan:
1.Test item:Internet based DTS
2.Software risk issues:Security testing,performance testing,Integration Testing.
3.Features to be tested(user stories):Register users,manager and member function,Admin Funtions,Transaction record/limits.
4.Features not to be tested:new version,Users Hands-on experience.
5.Approach:Whitebox, blackbox Testing(It contains code and UI)
6.Test deliverables:source code,Test scenario,test plan,test case,test execution report,test report,defect report.
7.item pass/fail criteria:User trying to login with correct credentials but not able to login(show stopper).
8.Suspension&Resumption criteria:show stooper in application/non-availabilty of resouce/when this is resolved
9.Responsibility:a.project manager:Review test cases, review and approve the issues.
		 b.Test Lead:Assigns tasks, tracks the testing progress,
		 c.Tester:Execute test cases, reports the issues,
		 d.Customer:UAT testing
10.STAFFING AND TRAINING NEED: Testers Needed are 5/training(performance,security testing,integration testing etc)
11.Schedule:2 weeks
